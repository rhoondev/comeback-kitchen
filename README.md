# The Comeback Kitchen

## A customizable virtual reality cooking simulation for physical, occupational, and cognitive rehabilitation of people suffering from brain injuries.

In this simulation, the user cooks a paella from start to finish. The instructions are given to the user through a floating cookbook, which provides verbal, auditory, and visual instruction on how to complete each step of the recipe. This process involves tasks like:
* Washing
* Cutting
* Blending
* Pouring
* Stirring
* Measuring
* Seasoning
* Boiling

## Known Issues

This project is still a work in process.

* Pinch pose for interacting with objects needs to be swapped out with a grab pose
* Cooking section is incomplete.
* Preparation section has functional cutting logic but the gameplay loop needs to be refactored and is currently not functional; knife prefab will require modification to correctly interact with sliceable objects
* Transparent materials such as the olive oil bottle, measuring cup, and jar, need to be converted to interactable materials (may require custom shader)
* Knob interaction does not work as intended
* Faucet interaction does not work as intended
* InfiniteGrabSpawner collider needs to be converted to trigger (while still being interactable) to prevent collisions with spawned objects (alternatively, it can be on a different layer that doesn't collide with the "Dynamic Object" layer)
* Circular washing progress bar does not face towards the player, which means it can sometimes be obscured
* The meshes and/or materials for mussels, onions, and shrimp are placeholders
* Tomato mesh is has visual artifacts when imported into Unity (issues are not visible in Blender)
* Interactable objects remain highlighted in white after the player stops interacting with them (they should return to their normal material with no rim alpha)
